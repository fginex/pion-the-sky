# pion-the-sky
Simple golang media server implemented using Pion webrtc. It records videos from a browser client and streams it back concatenated. The goal was to demonstrate how pion can be used as a bolt-on intermediary to a proprietary media server for interacting with webrtc browser clients by showing that a/v packets can be manipulated at the rtp level and even lower with transcoding.
